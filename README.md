## My classes and why I picked them
My parent class is Shape it is a abstract class.
My child class is Rectangle it takes Shape and adds a few methods on top such as perimetor and area.
My component class is called Points. it takes a rectangle and gets the points of the four corners.
My unrelated class is a circle and its interaction is a method that tests if the circle fits in the rectangle.
